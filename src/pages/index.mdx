	Hello! I usually go by the moniker Kognise <span role='button' id='ipa'>/ˈkägˌnaɪz/</span> on the Internet, though my real name is Lexi. Many things capture my interest, and this site features some of them. You may enjoy reading one of [the articles I've written](/writing).

	I recently quit my job to explore some projects of my own. In the past, I've worked at [Neuralink](https://neuralink.com/), [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/), [Replit](https://replit.com/), and [Redwood Research](https://www.redwoodresearch.org/).

	## Computers!

	I spend a significant portion of my time writing code and creating with technology. I believe in having passion for your craft and attention to detail. Since I just adore building things, I have a huge amount of side projects that I don't really know what to do with! You can [see an abridged list of stuff I've done](#projects) if you're interested.

	I use TypeScript, Rust, and React on a daily basis and love them. I used to daily drive NixOS with KDE Plasma (you can [check out my dotfiles](https://github.com/kognise/dotfiles/), they're not half bad) but now just use macOS and reserve NixOS for my desktop at home. I design everything for myself and for others using Figma.

	I'm often asked, "hey Lexi, what kind of programming do you do?", and I never quite know how to answer. I do everything. Frontend! Backend! Embedded hardware! Mobile apps! Compilers! Infrastructure! I find it immensely enjoyable to learn how shit works and go down rabbit holes, and I pick up whatever's needed to build what I'm excited about.

	A consistent thread through my recent life has been meeting my online programmer friends in person. Now, many of those closest to me and even some roommates have been people I've known for years, but only online! In the summer of 2021 I rode across the country on a hackathon on a [superdome train](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Dome_(railcar)), and since then, I've met friends as far as Europe and, perhaps more exotically, Kalamazoo, which I didn't previously realize was a real city in Michigan.

	9-year-old me making friends with a cool robot I made:

	<img src='/photos/robot.jpg' alt='A young girl holding hands with a robot made mostly out of cardboard and covered in tinfoil. The face of the robot has lit LEDs and some electronics can be seen inside. A desk with wires and a roll of tinfoil can be seen in the background.' width='800' height='765' loading='lazy' style='width: min(400px, 100%);' />

	## Airplanes!

	I think aviation is pretty cool. Over the pandemic I got really into flight simming and [VATSIM](https://vatsim.net/), and then I realized, hey, I can do this in real life.
	
	I started training for my Private Pilot License, first out of [KSSF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stinson_Municipal_Airport) and later [KBTV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Leahy_Burlington_International_Airport), but got peskily interrupted. But now I've un-interrupted myself, and I'm hopefully going to finish my license very soon!

	I'm currently learning to fly the good ol' [Cessna 172](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cessna_172). I pinned a [VFR wall planning chart](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav/productcatalog/planningcharts/vfrwall/) to my wall and I'm sticking pins in every airport I land at, and I'm hoping to visit as many airports in the U.S. as I can. I mentioned travelling earlier: when I have the chance, I also love flying as a passenger and I've spent many, many hours in coach visiting new horizons and making new friends.

	Here are some neat pictures I took while out flying:

	<div class='grid-twos'>
		<img src='/photos/plane-tunnel.jpg' alt='The parking area of a small airport, with two visible small planes. In the background is the runway and air traffic conctrol. The photograph is taken from the perspective of standing at the door, and is partially obscured by a brown ceiling held up by columns.' width='1400' height='788' loading='lazy' />

		<img src='/photos/plane-night.jpg' alt='San Antonio, Texas as seen from above at night. A wing strut can be seen in the foreground.' width='1400' height='788' loading='lazy' />

		<img src='/photos/plane-front.jpg' alt='A small Cessna plane sitting in a parking area, taken from the front. A beautiful blue sky with spread out fluffy clouds is on top.' width='1400' height='788' loading='lazy' />

		<img src='/photos/plane-cockpit.jpg' alt='The analog cockpit of a Cessna 172, with the plane rolling slightly to the left.' width='1400' height='788' loading='lazy' />
	</div>

	(This used to say "some neat pictures I took from the air" but two of them are clearly taken from the ground, so, that's fixed now.)

	In the spirit of ending these sections with pictures of young me, the oldest picture I have of myself is actually in a cockpit, in 2010. Perhaps an old Boeing 737? I must've been like 4 years old; clearly, my love of the skies isn't new.

	<img src='/photos/cockpit.jpg' alt='An airliner cockpit filled with analog gauges. Sitting in the pilot seat, a blurry child with a blond ponytail, red cowboy hat, and overalls.' width='800' height='1067' loading='lazy' style='width: min(350px, 100%);' />

	## Music!

	When I'm not programming, flying, or slacking off, I'm probably doing something music-related. I've been playing classical, jazz, folk, Balkan, and contemporary music on cello for almost 14 years. I compose music for acoustic instruments and create electronic bleep bloop sounds in a variety of styles using [Ableton](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/), [REAPER](https://www.reaper.fm/), [Pd](https://puredata.info/), and [Max](https://cycling74.com/products/max/). Perhaps I'll release an album eventually.

	The large portion of my time awake is spent listening to music. My taste is very multifaceted, but I primarily listen to upbeat music, across EDM, hyperpop, hip hop, orchestral, chamber, rock, pop, K-pop, J-pop, and more.

	Here are my favorite albums of all time, in no particular order:

	- [Aims by Vienna Teng](https://open.spotify.com/intl-de/album/4Ezl6L07JRUsUseRzWFywp?si=mVCTWIbcRNqqvZJZl4sWvQ) (experimental-ish floaty poppy vocal music)
	- [Nurture by Porter Robinson](https://album.link/us/i/1550626757) (electronic bliss)
	- [i know there's something left for you by Dynastic](https://album.link/us/i/1606797651) (rock? hyperpop? either way, it's amazing)
	- [More Songs About Buildings and Cows by The Meat Purveyors](https://album.link/us/i/5281169) (bluegrass)
	- [How to Tune a Fish by Beoga](https://album.link/us/i/1340253425) (irish music?)
	- [Wallsocket by underscores](https://album.link/us/i/1693478262) (amazing rock-hyperpop-edm blend)

	Here are some Spotify playlists I made:
	
	- [Some music that I think goes together](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2QmZKRwfy8FdBhaHfypfiG?si=cf889fce41a741a1)
	- [Turns out country music is actually... good?](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3pSyDUogiueIx4s10NrELs?si=69b7970b8a574330)
	- [Songs on a CD I made for my dad](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3meYnidcSYQkKMZOMJw38S?si=babe56a44eaf424a)
	- [The secular solstice tradition has some bangers](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6SNfyPElCn0muG6Xjjaxsd?si=6bdf61bb0bf74fd0)
	- [Catchy acoustic tunes](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7IEf7UPsvGcfAAJsJKkpBJ?si=1dffa8dee8124e26)
	- [Tons of old hyperpop](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2dhCAwEgT6U3ZZ18gsvZh1?si=168b68a723864647)

	I also used to [play Beat Saber badly](https://scoresaber.com/u/4470475412964296) and loved it, although I haven't had that much time recently. (For some reason, I was unusually good at one-handed mode. I could destroy even some top ranked players.) 

	## Other things!

	For the first time in my life, I've started taking pleasure in physical activity. I enjoy rock climbing and I've been getting into Brazilian jiu-jitsu. I wouldn't call myself a runner, but I ran a 15k and that felt pretty cool... some day I might even do a marathon.
	
	I love cooking, I'm a fan of the mise en place mindset, and I especially love hosting parties where we cook tons of food and I get to boss around a small army of sous chefs. I enjoy building mediocre furniture out of wood. I learned how to solve a Rubik's cube and got down to 40 seconds but stopped practicing. I'm also fascinated with the law, think accounting is pretty fun, and enjoy doing taxes so much I do my friends' taxes for them. I'll do yours for you if you want.

	Almost as much as I like engulfing myself in books, I like watching beautiful movies. Many of my favorite films are anime-style, including almost everything by Studio Ghibli as well as CoMix Wave Films; my favorite Ghibli movie is probably [Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087544/). Live-action movies that stuck out to me as really great are [Dr. Strangelove](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057012/), [Memento](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0209144/), and [Black Bag](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt30988739/). I'm also a die-hard fan of the How to Train Your Dragon trilogy. I consume actions flicks with great enjoyment, too, and I actually recently started tracking all the movies I'm watching in theaters on a site I built called [koggerboxd](https://tv.kognise.dev/).

	Some of my favorite books that I can 100% recommend:

	What else... I'm a dual German-U.S. citizen, which is neat. I have a [Lettera 22](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivetti_Lettera_22) manual typerwriter, an AKAI X-360D reel-to-reel tape recorder, a working analog telephone with a SIP proxy I wrote myself, a super old iMac, and a giant metal printer that makes incredible WHHHRRRRR-BBHHHHHH-BEEP noises.

	You might enjoy a piece of [writing](/writing) I synergized, or perhaps get a kick out of reading some [brand guidelines](/brand).

	And as always, feel free to shoot me an email or direct message me anytime, anywhere, and for any reason :)

	## Projects!
